The traffic light system using a CH32V003X operates by controlling Red, Yellow, and Green and default LEDs based on button inputs.
Three buttons manually activate individual lights, while a fourth button switches to an automatic cycle mode for emergency vehicle passage. 
The system ensures efficient traffic flow and emergency response management.
