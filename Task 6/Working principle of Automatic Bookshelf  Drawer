A Automatic Bookshelf  Drawer uses an ultrasonic sensor to detect the person. 
When an person is within 10 cm, the sensor triggers a servo motor to rotate, opening the Drawer.
Simultaneously, the LED inside the drawer turns ON, providing illumination for easy book searching.
When the person moves away, the light turns off, and the drawer closes automatically.
